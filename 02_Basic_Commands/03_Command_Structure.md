Terminal command follow a certain structure. Let's take a moment to dissect and understand it.

## Command: `ls`

This command will allow us to see the files and folders in the current working directory.

The first "word" in the terminal command is the name of the command to be executed. So with this command, you just type the name of the command, `ls`, and hit enter. There's nothing more to it.

## Another Command: `ls Development`

This command will allow us to see the files and folders inside the `Development/` directory.

The second "word" is the first _argument_ in the command. Every word after is another argument given to the command being executed. So here, `Development` is a **command argument**.

## One Last Command: `mkdir example1 example2`

This command will create a folder called `example1` and another folder called `example2`.

`mkdir` is the name of the command, `example1` is the _first_ argument, `example2` is the _second_ argument.
